# Linear-algebra--Spectral-Clustering-based-on-Graph-Laplacian
Spectral clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that identifies clusters in data by analyzing the eigenstructure of a similarity matrix. Unlike traditional clustering algorithms that use distance metrics in the original feature space, spectral clustering uses the eigenvectors of the similarity matrix to embed data into a lower-dimensional space where clusters become more distinct.

The method leverages the graph Laplacian, a matrix that represents pairwise relationships between data points. The Laplacian matrix, defined as 

L=D−A (where 

A is the similarity matrix and 

D is the diagonal degree matrix), plays a central role in spectral clustering. Its eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal the cluster structure: the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 indicates the number of connected components in the graph, while the eigenvectors can be used to separate clusters in a lower-dimensional subspace. The Laplacian’s positive semi-definite nature also ensures that its eigenvalues provide meaningful insights into the data's clustering.
